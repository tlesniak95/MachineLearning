# README for Neural Network Training and Cross-Validation

This README document provides an overview and instructions for a Python script designed to train a neural network (NN) on facial emotion data and evaluate its performance using cross-validation. The script demonstrates essential concepts in machine learning, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and the evaluation of model performance across different partitions of the data.

## Overview

The script performs the following tasks:

1. **Data Loading**: Loads a dataset containing features extracted from images of faces and their corresponding labels indicating emotional expressions.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Transforms labels to a binary format and appends a column of ones to the feature matrix to incorporate the bias term in the NN model.
3. **Neural Network Training**: Implements a simple neural network with one hidden layer, utilizing the logistic sigmoid activation function for both hidden and output layers.
4. **Backpropagation Algorithm**: Applies the backpropagation algorithm to update the weights of the network, aiming to minimize the prediction error.
5. **Cross-Validation**: Divides the dataset into training and testing sets to perform cross-validation, assessing the model's generalizability and performance on unseen data.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

You can install these packages using pip if not already available:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## Key Functions

- `logsig(_x)`: Computes the logistic sigmoid function, used as the activation function for neurons in the network.
- `train()`: Trains the neural network using a given dataset, applying forward propagation and backpropagation to update the network weights.
- `trainNNCrossValidation()`: Implements cross-validation to evaluate the neural network's performance, providing insights into the model's accuracy and generalizability.

## Usage

1. Run the script to load the facial emotion dataset. The script preprocesses the data and initializes the neural network's parameters.
2. Observe the training process, where the script iteratively updates the network weights to reduce the prediction error.
3. The script then performs cross-validation, dividing the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance across different data partitions.
4. Analyze the output, including the error rates across cross-validation folds, to assess the neural network model's effectiveness.

## Notes

- **Model Parameters**: The script sets initial parameters for the neural network, including the learning rate (`alpha`), the number of epochs (`L`), and the number of hidden nodes (`M`). Adjust these parameters based on your specific requirements or to explore their impact on model performance.
- **Data File**: Ensure that the `face_emotion_data.mat` file is correctly formatted and located in the same directory as the script.
- **Customization**: You may need to adjust the script to accommodate different datasets or to experiment with different neural network architectures.

This script offers a practical introduction to neural network training and evaluation, highlighting the importance of cross-validation in assessing model performance. By applying these techniques to a real-world dataset, users can gain valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of neural networks in pattern recognition tasks.
