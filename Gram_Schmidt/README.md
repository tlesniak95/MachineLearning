# README for Polynomial Data Analysis Script

This README provides an overview and usage guide for a Python script designed for polynomial data analysis from `.mat` files using NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib libraries. The script includes loading data, performing Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, fitting polynomials of various degrees to the data, and visualizing the results.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

## Data Format

The script expects a `.mat` file (`polydata.mat`) containing at least two variables: `a` and `b`. These variables represent the x and y coordinates of the data points, respectively. The script also tries to access an additional variable `X` for advanced analysis.

## Script Overview

1. **Data Loading**: The script loads data from `polydata.mat` using `scipy.io.loadmat` and extracts the variables `a` and `b` for analysis.

2. **Matrix Preparation**: Constructs matrices for polynomial fitting up to the third degree. This involves creating matrices with powers of `a` up to the third degree.

3. **Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization**: Implements the Gram-Schmidt process to orthogonalize a set of vectors. This function is used to create an orthonormal basis for the polynomial matrices.

4. **Polynomial Fitting**: Solves for the polynomial coefficients (`w`) for polynomials of degree 1 to 3 by minimizing the least squares error.

5. **Visualization**: Plots the original data points along with the polynomial fits of degrees 1, 2, and 3 to visualize the fitting.

6. **Advanced Analysis**: Performs additional manipulations and analysis on the variable `X` if available, including rank 1 approximation and residual error computation.

## Usage

1. Place your `polydata.mat` file in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

3. Observe the output in the console and the generated plot displaying the data points and polynomial fits.

## Functions

- `gram_schmidt(B)`: Performs the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process on matrix `B` and returns an orthonormal basis.

## Example Output

Upon running, the script will:

- Print the keys available in `polydata.mat`.
- Output the orthonormal basis for a sample matrix `B1` and the result of a matrix multiplication example.
- Display a plot of the data points with polynomial fits of degrees 1, 2, and 3.

## Note

Ensure that the `.mat` file format is compatible with the version used by `scipy.io.loadmat`. This script is designed for demonstration purposes and may require adjustments for different datasets or specific analysis requirements.
